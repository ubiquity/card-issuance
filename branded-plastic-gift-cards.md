Jin plans to visit the USA. He can get Ubiquity-branded plastic cards that will make a positive impression on investors.
If issuing cards from Stripe takes a long time, then we can explore branded plastic gift cards.

They will look similar to other cards but they are non-reloadable and usually have the word "GIFT" written on them.
Before issuing, we need to double-check with the provider's support that the cards from this provider can be used outside the US.

Services for issuing branded Gift cards exist in the US and other countries.
However, after a little research, I did not find such services in South Korea.

In case Stripe does not provide us the ability to issue branded cards, and gift cards issued in the US cannot be used outside the US, then we can look for branded gift card issuing services closer to South Korea.
