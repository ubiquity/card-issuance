The Stripe fiat-to-crypto onramp enables individuals to securely purchase cryptocurrencies directly from your platform or Dapp at the time of checkout. The onramp is fully customizable and you can integrate it into your product or service.
Stripe acts as the merchant of record for these onramp transactions and takes full liability for all fraud and disputes. Stripe also handles all regulatory requirements, know your customer (KYC) verifications, and sanctions screening. Customers have the option of saving payment methods, KYC data, and wallet information with Stripe, which makes the returning onramp experience much faster.

### Safe onramp kit

Developers can now embed Stripe’s onramp in their decentralized applications directly from the Safe{Core} SDK, reducing the barrier between Web2 and Web3.
The Onramp Kit helps users buy cryptocurrencies with fiat money to fund a Safe account via a credit card or other payment methods.

https://docs.safe.global/safe-core-aa-sdk/safe-core-sdk 

The Onramp Kit allows users to access on-ramp services and use them with their Safes.
These services can be used to buy crypto assets with credit cards or make SEPA transfers between their Safe and bank accounts (Monerium).

https://docs.safe.global/safe-core-aa-sdk/onramp-kit/reference

The Onramp Kit helps users buy cryptocurrencies with fiat money to fund a Safe account via a credit card or other payment methods.
The following guides show how to use the Onramp Kit and integrate it into your project by using one of the packs:
- Monerium Pack
- Stripe Pack

https://docs.safe.global/safe-core-aa-sdk/onramp-kit 

This guide demonstrates how to use the StripePack as part of the OnrampKit and incorporate it into your web application.

### Summary 

Stripe provides services that are interesting to Ubiquity.
To ensure the reliability of the account without the risk of its closure, we should comply with the requirements of the provider.

1. It's better to have a company registered in a country supported by Stripe, probably not related to crypto.
South Korea and BVI are not included in the list of such countries.

2. With a company registered in South Korea, we can apply for the Stripe Crypto payouts. 

3. If Alex approves this experiment, we can create a Stripe account for Alex’s personal company registered in the USA.

4. If we have a Stripe account, we can explore the Safe Onramp kit.
